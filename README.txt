I spent 8 hours messing with visual studio because I had not used it in a long time, I was trying to figure out how to compile with clang, and how to handle the input file, 
since VS is a bit different from the command line.

I Spent ~20 mins reading through the document + another 30 on the second read

I spent ~2 hours figuring out a high level solution without coding

I spent ~90 minutes working with getting the input into the 2d array (I hadn’t used C in a while, so I had to review pointers and converting the input)

I spent a couple hours implementing the all_paths() function.

7 hours doing some debugging and realizing i needed an array that was more than n^2

Spent 7 more hours realizing I needed to do BFS, and I had to figure out how to build a BFS algorithm from scratch without looking at any algorithm website

Another ~4 hours and I managed to solve a 3 x 3 matrix

I spent about 5 - 8 hours doing more coding after finding out the output was wrong for larger inputs

I stayed awake for over 24 hours, and finally managed to get a solution that works on 7 X 7 matrices and 5 X 5 matrices. I am not exaggerating about staying awake. 
I stayed awake from 10 am on monday to 5:08 pm right now as I type this document.

A few improvements I could make, but do not currently have the time for, would be to take care of any memory leaks, and to make the function work on a 1 X 1 matrix.

I am aware that I spent an obscene amount of time on this project, around 60 hours. The reason for that is because the last time I studied graphs was 2 years ago in my algorithms class. 
The requirements stated that I not search up any algorithms to help me with the project. I honored the requirement and did not search up any graph algorithms. 
So I essentially had to build BFS from scratch despite the fact that I was rusty on graphs.

I did briefly consider using Dijkstra's algorithm, but I did not feel that I could sufficiently recall it without reviewing it.

Anyway, that’s the end of my long rant. This is my code. It’s not perfect, and I probably spent more time on it than other candidates. 
But it mostly works and has plenty of comments to explain the code. I’d normally spend more time smoothing out the rough edges, but the deadline to submit is today. 
My writing is better than what you may see here. I’m rather tired. And hungry.
